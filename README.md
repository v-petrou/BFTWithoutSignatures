## Modules
### Binary Consensus
A binary consensus protocol performs consensus on a binary value b âˆˆ {0, 1}. The problem
can be formally defined in terms of three properties:
- Validity: if all correct processes propose the same value b, then any correct process
that decides, decides b.
- Agreement: no two correct processes decide differently.
- Termination: every correct process eventually decides.

#### Reliable Broadcast

#### Multi-Valued Consensus

#### Vector Consensus

#### Atomic Broadcast

## Install Golang
If you have not already installed [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) follow the instructions here.

## Clone Repository
```bash
cd ~/go/src/
git clone https://github.com/v-petrou/BFTWithoutSignatures.git
```

## Run
### Manually
To install the program and generate the keys run:
```bash
go install BFTWithoutSignatures
BFTWithoutSignatures generate_keys <N>      // For key generation
```
Open <N> different terminals. In each terminal run:
```bash
BFTWithoutSignatures <ID> <N> <t> <Clients> <Scenario>
```

### Script
Adjust the script (BFTWithoutSignatures/scripts/run.sh) and run:
```bash
bash ~/go/src/BFTWithoutSignatures/scripts/run.sh
```
When you are done and want to kill the processes run:
```bash
bash ~/go/src/BFTWithoutSignatures/scripts/kill.sh
```
